# Skin Cancer Detector

An AI-powered web application that aims to detect skin cancer from images of moles using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project leverages artificial intelligence to assist in the early detection of skin cancer. By analyzing images of moles and skin lesions, our model provides a preliminary assessment that can help users determine if they should seek professional medical advice.

## Key Features

- Upload images of moles or skin lesions
- AI-powered analysis using TensorFlow
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Educational resources about skin cancer and prevention

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: Python, JavaScript
- AI Model: TensorFlow
- Hardware: Intel AI PCs for enhanced performance

## How It Works

1. Users upload an image of a suspicious mole or skin lesion.
2. Our TensorFlow model, running on Intel AI PCs, analyzes the image.
3. The application provides a risk assessment based on the AI analysis, and a comprehensive report is generated, available for download.
